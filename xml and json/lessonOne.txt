1)why use xml?
You can use XML to transfer data between two systems that store the same data in different formats. For example, your website stores dates in MM/DD/YYYY format, but your accounting system stores dates in DD/MM/YYYY format. You can transfer the data from the website to the accounting system by using XML.

2)Where is XML most used?
Although the design of XML focuses on documents, the language is widely used for the representation of arbitrary data structures, such as those used in web services.

What are the advantages of using XML?
XML uses human, not computer, language. XML is readable and understandable, even by novices, and no more difficult to code than HTML. XML is completely compatible with Javaâ„¢ and 100% portable. Any application that can process XML can use your information, regardless of platform.

Why do we still use XML?
XML is still used in large scale, from the settings of an application to UI interface values. XML is used to generate or store various types of data from the user

What is an example of arbitrary data?
Arbitrary data is any data in any format. In the context of the Windows Media Player SDK, this means data in a format that is not supported by Windows Media Player. In the context of the Player, arbitrary data is simply binary data that the Player is not designed to play back natively



What is arbitrary structure?
It means "Some organisation of the data structure (including names of properties) that was just made up by some person" rather than being an established standard. The data structure is arbitrary.


Contrast with Established Standards
In contrast, an established standard might be something like the JSON Schema or XML Schema Definition (XSD), which provides a formal way to define the structure of JSON or XML data, including the types of properties, required fields, and relationships between data elements. For example, a JSON Schema for a person might specify that name must be a string, age must be an integer, and hobbies must be an array of strings, providing a clear and consistent way to validate and interpret the data.
****************** {
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "hobbies": ["reading", "hiking", "coding"],
  "favoriteColor": "blue",
  "contactInfo": {
    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "phone": "123-456-7890"
  }
}
